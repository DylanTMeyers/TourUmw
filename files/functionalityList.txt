Quizzes:
To take a quiz you must pick up an item that has a quiz associated with it. 
You will know that there is a quiz to go with an item when you open the backpack.
Once you open the backpack you can type '(item name) quiz' and then the quiz will start.
You then input the letter of the answer you choice. If the answer is right it will say 'Yay!'
and then give you a point. If the answer is wrong it will say 'Sorry, try again.' If 
you try to take a quiz again that you have already passed, it will tell you that you've 
already passed.

Talking to people:
If there is a person at a location, then you can type 'talk' to talk to them. You will be 
prompted to pick a dialogue option. You can either type 'Choice (number)' or just the number
of the choice. The dialogue will then happen starting with what you say and then how the
person responds. You will keep being prompted to talk until you type 'bye'. Then the person 
will say a goodbye message.

Baseball:
You can travel past Combes to the sports field. Here you will be prompted to watch a baseball
game. A simulation of a baseball game will occur. After three innings, you will be prompted to
cheer for a team. The team you cheer for will start to play better. If you want to leave the 
game, just type 'leave' when you are prompted to at the end of an inning.

Status:
As you tour the campus, a status is constantly shown above the input prompt. One point is added
to your total points every time you move to a different location and every time you pass a quiz.
Every five points you go up a level until you reach 'Platinum Eagle Status'.
